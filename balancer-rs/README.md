# Balancer Rust SDK

This project was funded by the [Balancer Grants subDAO](http://grants.balancer.community/). [Read the press release on Medium](https://medium.com/@BalancerGrants/balancer-is-adding-rust-support-c28bdc1305e6).

## Rust tools for interacting with Balancer Protocol V2 in Rust.

_DISCLAIMER: While balancer-rs is intended to be a useful tool to simplify interacting with Balancer V2 Smart Contracts, this package is an ALPHA-build and should be considered as such. Use at your own risk! This package is capable of sending Ethereum (or EVM compatible) tokens controlled by whatever private key you provide. User assumes all liability for using this software; contributors to this package are not liable for any undesirable results. Users are STRONGLY encouraged to experiment with this package on testnets before using it on mainnet with valuable assets._

## Project Goal

There isnâ€™t currently any Rust support in the Balancer ecosystem, so this SDK is a great way to attract Rust developers, as well as bring a popular, fast, and secure language to the growing collection of SDKs Balancer provides. Specifically, the Rust SDK will provide full Rust language support for interacting with:

- [Balancer Vault Contract](https://dev.balancer.fi/references/contracts/apis/the-vault)
- [Balancer Pools](https://dev.balancer.fi/references/contracts/apis/pools)

## Usage

balancer-rs has been tested on:

- MacOS using Rust 2021 edition
<!-- - Linux using Python 3.9-dev
- Windows using Python 3.9.5 -->
